# Form Application

It is a simple form application developed with Node.js and Express.js where I have used HTML, CSS & Tailwind in the frontend. It contains a simple form in which details are to be filled and stored in a database. To store data I have used a simple JSON file in /storage folder.


## How to run the application

1. Clone the application in your local system.

2. Open the application and initialize NPM by below cmd:

    ```
    npm init
    ```
3. Get the node modules package by below cmd:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the application by using nodemon by below cmd:
    ```
    nodemon
    ```
    or 
    
    ```
    node index.js
    ```

And the application will start running. You can now use it as desired.
